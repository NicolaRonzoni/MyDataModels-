# Univariate time series forecast with TADA algorithm-  
The algorithm in TADA was originally designed to perform Machine Learning predictions in Classification and Regression tasks – thus not forecasting. Recently though, it has been preliminarily tested on real world uniformly spaced time series with satisfactory performances.

Given monthly time varying input data, determine the optimal depth for the back-test method in order to perform predictions with the TADA algorithm.
Benchmarks of the algorithm as a function of ‘lags’ is performed against traditional techniques like ARIMA in short term forecast.
